title: A hard problem regarding continuous lattice
description: two definitions of way-below relation differ. It is still hard to prove that they are de facto equivalent to each other.

The discussion of denotational semantics of computer programs involves lattice theory.
In the procedure of introducing Scott semantics, in lattice theory there are several different 
concepts which are important: (why continuous lattice is especially important?)

complete partial order (cpo's), complete lattices, continuous lattices
and algebraic lattices.

In the definition of continuous lattice, it involves a crucial concept which is way-below.
Literally, "a is way-below than b" means a is far lower than b. 

In Henk.P.Barendregt (full name?) 's book, the definition of way-below is:

Let x, y belongs to <! math sign? !> D which is a cpo equipped with Scott topology, then we say
x is way below y (notation x << y) iff y is in the topological interior of {z | x <= z}.

However, on the wikipedia page of "domain theory", in the section of "way-below relation",
the definition of way-below is:
