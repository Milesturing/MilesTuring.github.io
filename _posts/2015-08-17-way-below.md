title: A hard problem regarding continuous lattice
description: Two definitions of way-below relation differ. It is still hard to prove that they are de facto equivalent to each other.
---
 
The discussion of denotational semantics of computer programs involves lattice theory.
In the procedure of introducing Scott semantics, in lattice theory there are several different 
concepts which are important: (why continuous lattice is especially important?)

Complete partial order (*cpo*'s), complete lattices, continuous lattices
and algebraic lattices.

In the definition of continuous lattice, it involves a crucial concept which is so-called "way-below 
relation". Literally, "$a$ is way below $b$" means $a$ is far lower than $b$. 

In H.P. (Henk) Barendregt's book <<The Lambda Calculus : Its Syntax and Semantics>>, 
the definition of way-below is:

[*Definition 1*] Let $x$, $y$ be elements in $C$ which is a *cpo* equipped with Scott topology, then we say
$x$ is way below $y$ (notation $x \ll y$) if y is in the topological interior of $\\{z | x \le z \\}$.

However, on the wikipedia page of "domain theory", in the sub-section of "way-below relation", the definition 
of way-below is:

[*Definition 2*] An element $x$ is way below an element $y$, if, for every directed set $D$ with supremum 
such that $y \le sup~D$, there is some element $d$ in $D$ such that $x \le d$. We also say that $x$ approximates 
$y$ and writes $x \ll y$.

It is obvious the two definitions are not appearing to be same. In fact, it is easy to obtain *Definition 2* 
from *Definition 1*, in the following steps:

1. If $y$ is in the (topological) interior of $\\{z | x \le z \\}$, it means there is a (Scott) open set $A$, 
such that $y$ is in $A$, and $A$ is a subset of $\\{z | x \le z \\}$.

2. Because open sets are upwards closed, given that $y \le sup~D$, $D$ is a directed set, we have $sup~D$ is in 
$A$. 

3. By the definition of open sets again, we have the intersection of $D$ and $A$ is non-empty.

4. Due to the fact $A$ is a subset of $\\{z | x \le z \\}$, we know that $D$ intersects $\\{z | x \le z \\}$. 

Therefore, *Definition 1* implies *Definition 2*.

Nevertheless, it is much harder to prove the other direction holds, *i.e.*, to prove *Definition 1* from *Definition 2*. 
The key difficulty is the difficulty in constructing the open set $A$ given that *Definition 1* holds. On the other hand, 
to construct a counterexample, we are required to prove the non-existence of such an $A$, which is difficult as well.

If such a counterexample existed, it would mean the both definitions are not *de facto* equivalent.

It is reported that *Definition 2* is the form used most commonly as the definition of "way-below relation".

A Scott domain is a bounded omega-algebraic *cpo*, and every algebraic *cpo* is a continuous *cpo*. Therefore
the concept of continuous lattice is relevant to Scott domain and the latter of which is relevant to
constructing semantics for untyped lambda calculus.
