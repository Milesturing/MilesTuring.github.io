title: Hard problem solved with a counterexample
description: The hard problem mentioned last time was solved. A counterexample is given to prove the in-equivalence of two definitions.

In the previous thread (dated 17 Aug 2015), we mentioned a problem of the difference between two definitions
of "way-below relation" which is hard to solve. It is difficult to prove the equivalence of two definitions or prove
they are not equivalent. This problem is solved on 19 Aug 2015 by author by explicitly giving a counterexample that 
Definition 2 does not imply Definition 1.
 
The counterexample is as following:

Let M be the set of natural numbers with an extra member: inf, which means infinity.

Now we consider the Cartesian product set M x M = {(m, n) | m, n are in M} with orders constructed from:
 
  (a, i) <= (a, j)      if i <= j or j == inf, and a is any natural number other than inf.
  (i, inf) <= (j, inf)  if i <= j or j == inf
  (i, 0) <= (j, 0)      if i <= j or j == inf

The last line above is to ensure that there is a least element (bottom). Now it is obvious the set M x M forms a cpo.
 
We let x be the element (0, inf), y be the element (inf, inf).
 
Then it can be shown that for every directed set D, y <= sup(D) implies that there exists element d in D, x <= d. 
 
However, there is no open Set U with y is in U and x <= U. Therefore, y is not in the topological interior of {z | x <= z} .

Therefore, it is a counterexample where Definition 2 holds but Definition 1 does not hold.
