title: Problem between different definitions solved
description: The problem mentioned in last post was solved. An elaborate counterexample is given to show the in-equivalence of two definitions.

In the previous thread (dated 17 Aug 2015), we mentioned a problem of the definitions
of "way-below relation" which is hard to solve. This problem is solved on 19 Aug 2015 by author by explicitly 
giving a counterexample where Definition 2 does not imply Definition 1.
 
The construction of counterexample is as following: Let M be the set of natural numbers with an extra member: inf.

Let us consider the Cartesian product set M x M = {(m, n) | m, n are in M} with the only orders generated from
(with transitivity):
 
  (a, i) <= (a, j)      , if i <= j or j == inf, and a is any natural number other than inf
  
  (i, inf) <= (j, inf)  , if i <= j or j == inf
  
  (i, 0) <= (j, 0)      , if i <= j or j == inf

The last line above is to ensure that there is a least element (bottom). It is obvious now that the set M x M forms a cpo.
 
We let x be the element (0, inf), y be the element (inf, inf).
 
Then it can be shown that for every directed set D, y <= sup(D) implies that there exists element d in D, x <= d. 
 
However, there is no open Set U with y is in U and x <= U. Therefore, y is not in the topological interior of {z | x <= z} .

Therefore, it is a counterexample where Definition 2 holds but Definition 1 does not hold. Hence the two definitions do
not agree.
